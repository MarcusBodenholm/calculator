A project to make a calculator using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, as part of the Odin Project. 

**Live preview:** [here](https://shedcape.github.io/calculator/)

## Built using

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (only vanilla)

### Tools
* Visual Studio Code
* Linux Terminal
* Git and Github

## Outcome

* Used HTML5 to create the structure
* Used CSS3 flex to create the layout
* Used Git and GitHub for project management
* Tried to model the basic functionality of the Windows calculator. Key goal was to permit the ability to execute = repeatedly to repeat the previous indicated operation. 

### What I learned
* Better knowledge of JavaScript
* Learned to add **keyboard support**, including visual response to key presses. 
* Learned to use REM instead of pixels for CSS, as well as media queries to have the size of the calculator adapt to the viewport. 

### What to improve
* To write cleaner code
* To learn CSS better. A realization during the project was that I had a harder time with CSS than JavaScript. 

### To do
* Add additional functionality, such as a button to switch between positive and negative numbers. 
* Clean up code to make it more readable and clearer.
